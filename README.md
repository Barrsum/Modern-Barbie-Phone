## Overview

Remember those fun toy phones from back in the day? This project brings that nostalgic vibe into the modern web! It's a simulated smartphone interface featuring:

*   A sleek design inspired by current smartphones (including a notch and home indicator bar).
*   A grid of tappable icons.
*   The core fun: clicking each icon plays a unique sound from a predefined list (the songs on the old Barbie phone!), using a randomized, non-repeating sequence for each cycle.
*   A dynamic status bar displaying the current time and date.
*   Switchable light and dark themes with corresponding wallpaper changes.
*   A responsive layout framed by a clean header and footer.

This project was built as part of the **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge, leveraging AI assistance for code generation, debugging, and iteration, embodying the "vibe coding" spirit of rapid prototyping and creative exploration with AI as a partner.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Wallpaper:** Background image changes based on the selected theme.
*   **Live Status Bar:** Displays the current time and date, updating every second.
